## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
  No outside sources were used.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
   A challenge I encoundered in creating this sumbmissions was formatting in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have little experience in these 3 concepts. Also some of the paramters for the functions were challenging for me to understand exactly what was being inputed or passed through the function. To overcome this challenge I read all of the informatoin in the drop down menu on the instructions webpage which was super helpful.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   Some questions I have about web development is how complex website games are created and how long it takes to create them. Obviously, the gamew we created was very basic, however, it still required alot of components.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
   If I had more time I would add more buttons to make the game more challenging and add images to the game buttons to make it more fun. I also would add a clock feature that limited the amount of time the player had to make their guesses.
